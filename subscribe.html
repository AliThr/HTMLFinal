                    China has surpassed the US to hold the most supercomputers in one country by a record 
                    margin—nearly 60—to become the nation with the most supercomputers, according to the 
                    latest Top 500 survey, one of the most comprehensive reports tracking high-performance 
                    computing. The report, out Monday (Nov. 13), came during the SC conference, an annual 
                    international meeting on high-performance computing networking since 1988, held this year 
                    in Denver.

                <p>
                    This makes their latest addition even more impressive; the world's most powerful 
                    supercomputer is now owned by China as well. The <i>Sunway TaihuLight</i> has over 
                    10.6 million cores, and when running at peak performance, the calculcations that it 
                    could reach as many as 125.4 Pflop/s. The laptop that this is being written on can perform 
                    20kflops/s. That's 6.25 trillion times slower.

                    The research team has made the pioneering breakthrough of the development 
                    of photonic computer chips that imitate the way the brain's synapses operate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The work, conducted by researchers from Oxford, Münster and Exeter universities, 
                    combined phase-change materials – commonly found in household items such re-writable 
                    optical discs – with specially designed integrated photonic circuits to deliver a 
                    biological-like synaptic response.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Crucially, their photonic synapses can operate at speeds a thousand times faster than 
                    those of the human brain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The team believes that the research could pave the way for a new age of computing, 
                    where machines work and think in a similar way to the human brain, while at the same 
                    time exploiting the speed and power efficiency of photonic systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The research is published in Science Advances.

                    Elon Musk unveiled today the new Tesla Roadster and the Tesla Semi, a revolutionary new addition to 
                    the market of goods vehicles.

                        The Tesla Roadster, their new top-of-the-line electric super car, will have an extraordinary 
                        acceleration of 0-62mph in just 1.9 seconds, making it the quickest production road car today. 
                        To put that in perspective, the average Formula 1 car reaches 60mph in around 2.4 seconds, and the 
                        Saturn V rocket's first stage could accelerate from 0-60mph in 1.5 seconds, with 5 rocket thrusters 
                        that <i>each</i> produced 200,000,000 horsepower! To top all that, it is set to have a range of over 
                        1,000km, which is, by far, the furthest range for any electric vehicle available today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Tesla Semi, the first of its kind in the industry, is a fully electric HGV, with a range of up to 
                        500 miles on a single charge, 400 miles of which it can recharge in 30 minutes. This is not the only 
                        reason that it is revolutionary, as it will also (hopefully) be the safest HGV in the world. This is 
                        due to the vast number of safety features implemented by Tesla, including automatic drive assist, which 
                        will prevent crashes and save lives by keeping the vehicle inside the lane that it is in if the driver 
                        stops responding, and will then pull the vehicle safely over to the side of the road, and if it does not 
                        receive any response from the driver, in the case of them falling unconcious, or having a life threatening 
                        episode such as a seizure, stroke or heart attack, it will call the emergency services.
